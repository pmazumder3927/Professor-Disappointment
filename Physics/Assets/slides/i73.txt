The bittersweetness of our passion has drawn our paths near,
But twas merely a curve in your journey that alighted us so nigh,
I have done my best to set you forth with the passion I have gleaned,
Use these gifts, and follow your dreams wherever they take you,
Know this, you have given me a drive and will to go on and keep teaching,
And by this I yearn of you to not let your path stop here,
Soar to the Heavens and Fly with physics--
