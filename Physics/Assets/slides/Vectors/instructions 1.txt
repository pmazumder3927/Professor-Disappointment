You are a dissapoint my dear!
Oh not you, I meant all those millions of people who will never know the wonders of physics.
Ahh but I ramble
You may notice that you cannot move
This is because you have not yet begun your path in understanding the beauty of physics.
I will be here to guide you on your path
You will now learn of vectors which will allow you to move about freely in this world
