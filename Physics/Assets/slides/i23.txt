OOh deer my monicle almost left me for a better man,
Ahh who am I kidding there are no better men
or women than the mother of nature who lords over the universe with physics as her scepter
Ahh but I ramble,
Congratulations on completing your second splendid session of salvatious physics
Keep learning like this and there won't be anything left to teach!
Ahh the job security, now move along before someone catches you being awesome
